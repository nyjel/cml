"""
The diffusive CML class:  responsible for initializing defaults, iterating and managing the matrix
if the global coupling gg is set to zero, the dynamics are the coupled map lattice.
The following parameters result in different pattern formation regimes or phases:
frozen chaos: a<1.5
The sites are divided into the clusters with various sizes. The divided pattern can be regarded as an attractor.
With the different initial condition, the pattern of the clusters will be changed, thus it is known that the many attractors co-exist in the system.
The number of attractors increases (at least) exponentially with the increase of N.

pattern selection: e.g., a=1.71, gl=0.4 gg=0
The sites are divided into the clusters with almost the same sizes. The size of the clusters depends on the parameters.

chaotic Brownian motion of defect: e.g., a=1.85, gl=0.1
In the case of the above pattern selection, some phase defects sometimes remain in the system.
These defects fluctuates chaotically like Brownian motion.

defect turbulence: e.g., a=1.895, gl=0.1, gg=0
The many defects are generated and collide each other like the turbulence.

spatiotemporal intermittency: e.g., a=1.75, gl=0.3
The each site transits between the coherent state and the chaotic state intermittently.

fully developed spatiotemporal chaos: e.g., a=2.0, gl=0.3
Almost all the sites oscillate chaotically independently.

traveling wave: e.g., a=1.47, gl=0.5, gg=0
The wave of clusters travels at the very low speed.
